        <strong>Marco Verratti debuted on Pescara's (an Italian soccer team) first team when he was only fifteen. </strong> What were you doing when you were fifteen? That's right, you were doing nothing. We all could take a page out of Marco's book. At Pescara, Marco Verratti played the best football in Italy, won many awards, and was noticed by PSG. Enticed by money as many are, he packed his bags for Paris.

        <strong>Verratti signed for Paris Saint Germain in 2012.</strong> Since then his legend status has not faltered even once. He may be short, but his first touch and trickery on the ball are unparalleled.

        <strong>I would definitely buy a jersey with his name on it, </strong> but it is insane how much more a player name jersey costs as compared to a plain one. He is currently 28, which means he has a couple more years in the sport, but when he retires I might have to cop the jersey. I dunno.
